Window Mover
===========

##### Purpose
When you have a window that you can't grab, this application will allow you to get to those windows.

##### How it works
This application registers a global Windows keyboard shortcut that allows you to bring up a context menu of active windows.  When you select an option from the menu, the window is moved to the position of your mouse.  The default shortcut is Win + Alt + A, but you can have any combination of Win, Alt, Shift, Ctrl and a keyboard character.
